# RandomPartitioner
Pharo library for partitioning a collection. Given a set of K proportions, for example 50%, 30%, and 20%, it shuffles the collection and divides it into K non-empty subsets in such a way that every element is included in exactly one subset. Can be used for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
